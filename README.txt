 Modification to do the following from thomas' email: 10/02/2019
    Hi - Here's a list that I wrote down for things as we move forward:

    1. For the SAT-SEF paper, we'll work out the r_{SC} findings, both for SEF-SEF pairs, and SEF-SC/FEF pairs.
    - Continue to plot both signal corr. and noise corr.
    - Compare results for Correct trials with results for Error trials (Chenchal)
    - Make a note of neurons that have selective RF (Thomas)
    - Plot distribution of spike waveform width (Chenchal)
    - Compute distance between electrodes (Thomas/Chenchal)
    - For this, we'll need: (a) grid locations; (b) drive config. (i.e. 1x4 or 2x2); (c) how Rich assigned channel numbers to electrodes
    - Do this separately for Da & Eu
    - Plot noise corr. as a function of distance (pair on same electrode vs. pair on separate electrode)

    2. For the "long run" (i.e. after the SAT-SEF paper), we'll work out the JPSTH analysis.
    - Plot separate steps used to compute JPSTH matrix for Thomas to visualize
    - Use Poisson spike train generator to test peculiar pairs

    Let me know if this looks O.K. to you, or if I missed anything.

    Thanks,
    --Thomas
